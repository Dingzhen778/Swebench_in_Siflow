Welcome to the Sphinx 4.1.0 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.

Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.

Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1. If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.

The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst". Only files with this suffix are considered documents.

One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
Indicate which of the following Sphinx extensions should be enabled:
Note: imgmath and mathjax cannot be enabled at the same time. imgmath has been deselected.

A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.

Creating file /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_quickstart_defaults0/source/conf.py.
Creating file /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_quickstart_defaults0/source/index.rst.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_quickstart_defaults0/source/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

You should now populate your master file /tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_quickstart_and_build0/source/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Welcome to the Sphinx 4.1.0 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.

Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.

Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1. If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.

The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst". Only files with this suffix are considered documents.

One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
Indicate which of the following Sphinx extensions should be enabled:
Note: imgmath and mathjax cannot be enabled at the same time. imgmath has been deselected.

A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
