```python
### django/utils/autoreload.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    args = [sys.executable] + ['-W%s' % o for o in sys.warnoptions]
=======
    args = [sys.executable] + ['-W%s' % o for o in sys.warnoptions] + ['-X%s' % o for o in sys._xoptions]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that any `-X` options passed to the Python interpreter are also included when the auto-reloader restarts the server. This addresses the issue where the `-X utf8` option was not being passed through to the reloaded process.
