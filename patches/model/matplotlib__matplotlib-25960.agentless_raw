The issue described in the bug report indicates that the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters in `Figure.subfigures` are not having any effect. This suggests that the spacing parameters are not being properly applied to the subfigures.

Upon reviewing the provided code segments, it appears that the `GridSpec` object created in `Figure.subfigures` is not being used to update the spacing parameters for the subfigures. We need to ensure that the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters are correctly applied to the subfigures.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### lib/matplotlib/figure.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        sfarr = np.empty((nrows, ncols), dtype=object)
        for i in range(ncols):
            for j in range(nrows):
                sfarr[j, i] = self.add_subfigure(gs[j, i], **kwargs)
=======
        sfarr = np.empty((nrows, ncols), dtype=object)
        for i in range(ncols):
            for j in range(nrows):
                subfig = self.add_subfigure(gs[j, i], **kwargs)
                subfig.set_subplotspec(gs[j, i])
                sfarr[j, i] = subfig
        # Apply the wspace and hspace to the GridSpec
        gs.update(wspace=wspace, hspace=hspace)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters are applied to the `GridSpec` after the subfigures are added to the figure. This should resolve the issue where the spacing parameters are not having any effect.
