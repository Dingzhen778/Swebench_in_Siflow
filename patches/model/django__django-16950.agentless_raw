Based on the issue description, the problem seems to be related to how the `UUIDField` is being handled when creating a new `Thing` with inline `SubThing` objects in the Django admin. Specifically, the `id` field of the `Thing` model is being set to `null` when a `SubThing` is added alongside the `Thing`.

The issue likely lies in how the form is being processed in the admin. We need to ensure that the `id` field is properly initialized with the default value (`uuid.uuid4`) even when inline forms are present.

Let's make a change in the `formfield_for_dbfield` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to ensure that the `UUIDField` is properly initialized with its default value.

```python
### django/contrib/admin/options.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # For any other type of field, just call its formfield() method.
        return db_field.formfield(**kwargs)
=======
        # Ensure UUIDField uses its default value if not provided
        if isinstance(db_field, models.UUIDField) and 'initial' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['initial'] = db_field.default
        
        # For any other type of field, just call its formfield() method.
        return db_field.formfield(**kwargs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `UUIDField` in the `Thing` model will use its default value (`uuid.uuid4`) when a new `Thing` is created, even if inline forms are present. This should prevent the `id` field from being set to `null` and resolve the issue.
