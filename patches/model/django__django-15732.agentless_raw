To address the issue of being unable to drop the `unique_together` constraint on a single field with its own `unique=True` constraint, we need to ensure that the migration correctly handles the removal of the `unique_together` constraint without interfering with the primary key constraint.

The problem lies in the fact that the migration is trying to remove a unique constraint that conflicts with the primary key constraint. We need to modify the migration logic to handle this case properly.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _delete_index_sql(self, model, name, sql=None, concurrently=False):
        sql = (
            self.sql_delete_index_concurrently
            if concurrently
            else self.sql_delete_index
        )
        return super()._delete_index_sql(model, name, sql)
=======
    def _delete_index_sql(self, model, name, sql=None, concurrently=False):
        # Check if the index name matches a unique constraint on a single field
        # that also has a unique=True constraint.
        if name.endswith('_uniq'):
            # Get the table and column names from the index name
            table_name = model._meta.db_table
            column_name = name.split('_')[-2]
            
            # Check if the column has a unique=True constraint
            unique_fields = [field.column for field in model._meta.fields if field.unique]
            if column_name in unique_fields:
                # Skip removing the unique constraint if it conflicts with a unique=True constraint
                return []
        
        sql = (
            self.sql_delete_index_concurrently
            if concurrently
            else self.sql_delete_index
        )
        return super()._delete_index_sql(model, name, sql)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds a check to the `_delete_index_sql` method to skip removing a unique constraint if it conflicts with a `unique=True` constraint on the same column. This should prevent the migration from failing when trying to drop the `unique_together` constraint on a single field that also has a `unique=True` constraint.
