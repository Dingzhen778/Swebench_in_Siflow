Based on the issue description, the problem lies in the `lookup_allowed` method of the `ModelAdmin` class. The method incorrectly treats a foreign key field as a primary key as if it were a concrete inheritance, leading to incorrect lookups.

To fix this, we need to modify the `lookup_allowed` method to correctly handle foreign key fields used as primary keys. Specifically, we need to ensure that the method does not shortcut the lookup when a foreign key is used as a primary key.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:
