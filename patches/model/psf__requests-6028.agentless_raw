Based on the issue description, the problem seems to be related to how the `Proxy-Authorization` header is being handled in Python 3.8.12. The issue mentions that using any other version of Python works fine, which suggests a change in behavior in Python 3.8.12 that affects the handling of proxy authentication.

The `proxy_headers` method in `requests/adapters.py` is responsible for adding the `Proxy-Authorization` header. It appears that the `get_auth_from_url` function might not be correctly extracting the username and password from the proxy URL in Python 3.8.12.

To address this, we can ensure that the `get_auth_from_url` function is correctly extracting the credentials and that the `Proxy-Authorization` header is being set properly.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### requests/adapters.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        username, password = get_auth_from_url(proxy)

        if username:
            headers['Proxy-Authorization'] = _basic_auth_str(username,
                                                             password)
=======
        auth = get_auth_from_url(proxy)
        if auth:
            username, password = auth
            headers['Proxy-Authorization'] = _basic_auth_str(username, password)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the `get_auth_from_url` function returns a tuple, and we correctly unpack it to set the `Proxy-Authorization` header. This should resolve the issue with the 407 status code.
