Based on the issue description, the problem lies in the `catch_all_view` function where it redirects to a URL without including the `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`. The `request.path_info` does not include the script name, while `request.path` does. We need to modify the code to use `request.path` instead of `request.path_info`.

However, the provided code segment does not contain the `catch_all_view` function. To properly address the issue, we need to locate the `catch_all_view` function and make the necessary changes.

Assuming the `catch_all_view` function is located in a file such as `django/views/default.py`, here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### django/views/default.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
return redirect('%s/' % request.path_info)
=======
return redirect('%s/' % request.path)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

If the `catch_all_view` function is located in a different file, please provide the correct file path, and I will adjust the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit accordingly.
