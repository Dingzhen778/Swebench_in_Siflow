To address the issue where `a.is_even` does not imply `a.is_finite`, we need to ensure that when a symbol is created with the `even` assumption, it also implicitly has the `finite` assumption. This can be done by modifying the `__new__` method in the `Symbol` class to set the `finite` assumption to `True` if the `even` assumption is `True`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### sympy/core/symbol.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __new__(cls, name, **assumptions):
        """Symbols are identified by name and assumptions::

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> Symbol("x") == Symbol("x")
        True
        >>> Symbol("x", real=True) == Symbol("x", real=False)
        False

        """
        cls._sanitize(assumptions, cls)
        return Symbol.__xnew_cached_(cls, name, **assumptions)
=======
    def __new__(cls, name, **assumptions):
        """Symbols are identified by name and assumptions::

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> Symbol("x") == Symbol("x")
        True
        >>> Symbol("x", real=True) == Symbol("x", real=False)
        False

        """
        cls._sanitize(assumptions, cls)
        
        # Ensure that if a symbol is even, it is also finite
        if assumptions.get('even', False):
            assumptions['finite'] = True
        
        return Symbol.__xnew_cached_(cls, name, **assumptions)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that whenever a symbol is created with the `even` assumption, it will also have the `finite` assumption set to `True`. This aligns with the expectation that an even number should be finite.
