This change ensures that the `use_rtype` configuration is respected even when there is only one return value. The original logic was setting `use_rtype` to `False` for multiple return values, but it was not correctly handling the case where there is only one return value. By moving the `use_rtype` assignment outside the `multi` check, we ensure that the configuration is applied consistently.
