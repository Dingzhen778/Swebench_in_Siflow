This change ensures that the `ORDER BY` terms are only added once to the SQL query, which should prevent the `ProgrammingError` caused by referencing a column that is not in the select list. The `continue` statement skips adding duplicate `ORDER BY` terms, and the `result.append((sql, params))` line ensures that valid `ORDER BY` terms are included in the final query.
