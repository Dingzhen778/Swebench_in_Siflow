Based on the issue description, the problem arises because Django 4.2 no longer allows aggregate functions to be used over window functions directly. This is a change in behavior from previous versions. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly without violating the new constraints.

The solution involves breaking down the query into two steps:
1. Annotate the queryset with the window function.
2. Perform the aggregation on the annotated queryset.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### your_app/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
queryset = queryset.annotate(
    cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
    DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
    cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)
=======
# Step 1: Annotate the queryset with the window function
annotated_queryset = queryset.annotate(
    cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)

# Step 2: Perform the aggregation on the annotated queryset
aggregate = annotated_queryset.aggregate(
    DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
    cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the window function is applied first, and then the aggregation is performed on the annotated queryset, which should resolve the `psycopg2.errors.GroupingError` you encountered.
