This *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit ensures that the `Meta.ordering` fields are not included in the `GROUP BY` clause when they are part of the default ordering. The condition `not self.query.default_ordering` is added to skip adding these fields to the `GROUP BY` clause if they are part of the default ordering.
