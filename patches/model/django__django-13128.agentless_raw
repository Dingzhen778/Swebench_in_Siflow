To address the issue, we need to ensure that the `annotate` method correctly handles the subtraction of `DateTimeField` and the addition of a `timedelta` object. The error indicates that the expression contains mixed types, and we need to specify the `output_field` to resolve this.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```python
### your_app/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Experiment.objects.annotate(
    delta=F('end') - F('start') + Value(datetime.timedelta(), output_field=DurationField())
)
=======
from django.db.models import F, Value, DurationField
from datetime import timedelta

Experiment.objects.annotate(
    delta=(F('end') - F('start')) + Value(timedelta(), output_field=DurationField())
)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the `delta` annotation is correctly computed by specifying the `output_field` for the `Value` expression. The `timedelta` object is also correctly wrapped in a `Value` expression with the appropriate `output_field`.

Additionally, ensure that the necessary imports are included at the top of the file:

```python
### your_app/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.db import models
=======
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, Value, DurationField
from datetime import timedelta
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should resolve the `FieldError` and allow the temporal subtraction to work correctly without using `ExpressionWrapper`.
