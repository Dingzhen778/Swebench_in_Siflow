The issue described in the repository is related to the order of `OneToOneField` definitions in the `Picking` model. Specifically, the `parent_link=True` attribute should be correctly identified regardless of the order of the fields. However, Django seems to be getting confused when the `origin` field is defined before the `document_ptr` field.

To address this, we need to ensure that Django correctly identifies the `document_ptr` field as the parent link, regardless of its position in the model definition. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in `django/db/models/base.py` to properly handle the `parent_link` attribute.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

This edit ensures that the `parent_link` attribute is correctly identified and applied, regardless of the order of the fields in the model definition. This should resolve the issue where the order of `OneToOneField` definitions affects the behavior of the `parent_link` attribute.
