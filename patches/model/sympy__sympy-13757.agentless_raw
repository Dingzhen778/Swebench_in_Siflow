            # Unfortunately, this isn't smart enough to consider combining into
            # exponents that might already be adds, so things like:
            #  z - y    y
            # x      * x  will be left alone.  This is because checking every possible
            # combination can slow things down.

This *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit ensures that when a `Poly` object is multiplied by a symbol, the multiplication is evaluated correctly. The specific check for `Poly` and `Symbol` types is added to handle the issue described in the problem statement.
