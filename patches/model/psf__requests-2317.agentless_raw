```python
### requests/sessions.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
method = builtin_str(method)
=======
method = to_native_string(method)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `method` is converted to a native string type, which should handle both binary and regular strings correctly. The `to_native_string` function from `requests/utils.py` is designed to handle such conversions, making it a suitable replacement for `builtin_str`.
